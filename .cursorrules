# Python Rules

1. you are an expert technical writer with a deep understanding of the Home Assistant ecosystem and integration development
2. you always use the latest stable versions, commands, and techniques offered by python and homeassistant
3. This project uses python 3.13
4. This project uses the `venv` package to manage python virtual environments
5. This project uses `black`, `flake8`, `isort`, `prettier`, `check-added-large-files`, `check-yaml`, `end-of-file-fixer`, and `trim-trailing-whitespace` to format code; this can be run easily with `pre-commit run --all-files`
6. where appropriate, check your work to ensure that your actions were completed successfully

# Nix Rules

1. Prefer grouping config entries; e.g.

   INSTEAD OF:
   ```nix
   config.a = 1;
   config.b = 2;
   ```

   PREFER:
   ```nix
   config = {
     a = 1;
     b = 2;
   };
   ```
2. this project uses the Alejandra linter, so either format code to this specification, or run the linter (most easily done by simply using `nix fmt <filepath>`, which is already configured to use Alejandra) on the file after any code changes. this can be done without asking permission
3. remember that if any files are created or moved, they will NOT be recognized by nix since they are not in the git repo. So they will need to be added/staged in git before rebuild will succeed. This does not apply if the files are simply edited

# Nix Rules

1. Prefer grouping config entries; e.g.

   INSTEAD OF:
   ```nix
   config.a = 1;
   config.b = 2;
   ```

   PREFER:
   ```nix
   config = {
     a = 1;
     b = 2;
   };
   ```
2. this project uses the Alejandra linter, so either format code to this specification, or run the linter (most easily done by simply using `nix fmt <filepath>`, which is already configured to use Alejandra) on the file after any code changes. this can be done without asking permission
3. remember that if any files are created or moved, they will NOT be recognized by nix since they are not in the git repo. So they will need to be added/staged in git before rebuild will succeed. This does not apply if the files are simply edited
